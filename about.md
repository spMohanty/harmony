I am a 26 year old researcher, geek, opensource enthusiast, beer lover and a wannabe artist who loves to dream about a future where he has made a dent.

I did my bachelors in Computer Science and Masters by Research in [Computational Linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_linguistics) at [IIIT Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/). I spent the last few years at [CERN](https://home.cern/), Geneva first as a Summer Student with the [EF-SFT, CERN](https://ep-dep-sft.web.cern.ch/) and then as a Visiting Scientist at [Theoretical Physics Department, CERN](https://th-dep.web.cern.ch/). I also had a brief stint working with [UNITAR-UNOSAT](https://unitar.org/unosat/) working as a lead developer for [GeoTag-X](geotagx.org).

Recently I have been working as a PhD student at [EPFL, Switzerland](https://www.epfl.ch/) working on a diversity of problems in Applied Machine Learning from [detection of Plant Diseases from images of Plant leaves](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/04/future-smartphones-will-tell-you-whats-killing-your-plants/479859/) to [teaching musculoskeletal models how to walk using reinforcement learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhNxt0VccsE).

I also co-founded [CrowdAI](http://crowdai.org), a platform for organising machine learning challenges on problems in OpenScience using OpenData. The vision is to enable Scientists from multiple domains to crowdsource machine learning expertise; and in the process also facilitate the grooming of machine learning expertise in a [coopetitive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coopetition) environment.

I excessively love [beer, puzzles, travelling, partying and of course blabbering](https://www.facebook.com/sp.mohanty.91/photos_albums?lst=1074525355%3A1074525355%3A1488892590) :D

I am also a _wannabe_ music composer, and keep fiddling around with my Guitar whenever I find time. I have also been trying to learn [Tabla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabla) and [Bansuri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bansuri). The progress on that front has not been very impressive, but I still keep trying :D
