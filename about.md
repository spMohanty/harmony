I am a 26 year old researcher, hacker, geek, opensource enthusiast and beer lover who loves to dream....about a future where I have made a dent.

I did my bachelors in Computer Science and Masters by Research in Computational Linguistics at [IIIT Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/). I spent the last few years at [CERN](https://home.cern/), Geneva first as a Summer Student with the [EF-SFT, CERN](https://ep-dep-sft.web.cern.ch/) and then as a Visiting Scientist at [Theoretical Physics Department, CERN](https://th-dep.web.cern.ch/). I also had a brief stint working with [UNITAR-UNOSAT](https://unitar.org/unosat/) working as a lead developer for [GeoTag-X](geotagx.org). Recently I have been working as a PhD student at [EPFL, Switzerland](https://www.epfl.ch/) working on a whole diversity of problems in Applied Machine Learning from detection of Plant Diseases from images of Plant leaves to teaching musculoskeletal models how to walk using reinforcement learning.

Apart from my research, I also co-founded [CrowdAI](http://crowdai.org), a platform for organising machine learning challenges on problems in OpenScience using OpenData. The vision is to enable Scientists from multiple domains to crowdsource machine learning expertise; and in the process also facilitate the grooming of machine learning expertise in a [coopetitive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coopetition) environment.

I am an opensource enthusiast, and have been associated with [Google Summer of Code](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/) since 2012, first as a student, then as a mentor and now as an org-admin for an humanitarian opensource organisation called as [Sigmah](http://www.sigmah.org/). As a hackathon addict, I religiously attend all the hackathons I can, and my projects page has more details about some hacks from a few hackathons I recently attended.

I excessively love [beer, puzzles, travelling, partaayyyinngg and of course blabbering](https://www.facebook.com/sp.mohanty.91/photos_albums?lst=1074525355%3A1074525355%3A1488892590) :D

I am also a wannabe music composer, and keep fiddling around with my Guitar whenever I find time. I have also been trying to learn [Tabla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabla) and [Bansuri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bansuri). The progress on that front has not been very impressive, but I still keep trying :D
